nlp-probabilistic-models
========================

More code related to Natural Language Processing (NLP). To complete an on-line
course on NLP with probabilistic models, I had to finish 4 programming
assignments. The solution to the corresponding problems can be found in the
following Jupyter notebooks:

* [Autocorrect](x)
* [Part of Speech Tagging](x)
* [Autocomplete](x)
* [Word Embeddings](x)
