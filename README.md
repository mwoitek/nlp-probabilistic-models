nlp-probabilistic-models
========================

More code related to Natural Language Processing (NLP). To complete an on-line
course on NLP with probabilistic models, I had to finish 4 programming
assignments. The solution to the corresponding problems can be found in the
following Jupyter notebooks:

* [Autocorrect](https://github.com/mwoitek/nlp-probabilistic-models/blob/master/Week1/C2_W1_Assignment.ipynb)
* [Part of Speech Tagging](https://github.com/mwoitek/nlp-probabilistic-models/blob/master/Week2/C2_W2_Assignment.ipynb)
* [Autocomplete](https://github.com/mwoitek/nlp-probabilistic-models/blob/master/Week3/C2_W3_Assignment.ipynb)
* [Word Embeddings](https://github.com/mwoitek/nlp-probabilistic-models/blob/master/Week4/C2_W4_Assignment.ipynb)
